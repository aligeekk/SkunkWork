# SkunkWork
Neural Network Trainer Package for Pytorch.

## SkunkWork package usage
### 1. Install custom package

Install the package locally (for use on our system):
`pip install .`

Install the package with a symlink, so that changes to the source files will be immediately available to other users of the package on our system: **(This was used)**
`pip install -e .`

### 2. Test by `import SkunkWork`
